# How Email Sending Works in My Next.js App (Contact Form Example)

This note explains the process of sending an email from a contact form in a Next.js application using a dedicated email service like Resend.

## Core Problem

-   Browsers (frontend JavaScript) **cannot** send emails directly due to security risks (exposing credentials like passwords or API keys).
-   Sending emails directly from the application's hosting server (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) is **unreliable** because:
    -   Server IP addresses often have poor or no **email sending reputation**, leading to emails being marked as spam.
    -   Many hosting platforms **restrict or block** outgoing connections on standard email ports (like port 25) to prevent abuse.

## Solution Overview

The standard and reliable solution involves using a **Transactional Email Service (TES)** like **Resend**. The process uses a secure **Next.js API Route** as an intermediary.

## The Flow (Step-by-Step)

1.  **User Interaction (Frontend - `ContactPage.jsx`)**
    *   The user fills out the form fields (name, email, message, etc.) in the React component.
    *   The component uses `useState` to manage the form data as the user types.

2.  **Form Submission (Frontend)**
    *   The user clicks the "Send Message" button (type="submit").
    *   The `<form>` element's `onSubmit` event handler function is called.
    *   `event.preventDefault()` stops the browser's default form submission behavior.
    *   A loading state (e.g., `submissionStatus = 'submitting'`) is set to provide visual feedback (disabling the button, showing a spinner).

3.  **API Request (Frontend -> Backend)**
    *   The frontend `onSubmit` handler uses the browser's `fetch` API.
    *   It sends an HTTP `POST` request to a specific backend endpoint defined within the Next.js app.
    *   **Endpoint:** Our custom Next.js API route (e.g., `/api/send-contact-message`).
    *   **Headers:** Specifies `Content-Type: application/json` to indicate the data format.
    *   **Body:** The form data (from the React state) is converted into a JSON string (`JSON.stringify(formData)`) and sent as the request body.

4.  **Processing (Backend - API Route `/api/send-contact-message/route.js`)**
    *   The Next.js API route (which runs on the server-side, Node.js environment) receives the incoming `POST` request.
    *   It parses the JSON data from the request body using `await request.json()`.
    *   **Security:** This is the secure environment where sensitive operations occur. It accesses the **Resend API Key** stored securely in **environment variables** (`process.env.RESEND_API_KEY`). *The API key is never exposed to the frontend browser.*
    *   It performs necessary validation on the received data (e.g., checking if required fields are present).
    *   It imports and initializes the Resend library (`new Resend(apiKey)`).

5.  **Email Relay (Backend -> Resend Service)**
    *   The API route uses the Resend library to make an API call to Resend's servers.
    *   It calls a function like `resend.emails.send({...})`, passing the required email parameters:
        *   `from`: The verified sender email address (e.g., `Your Name <noreply@yourdomain.com>`).
        *   `to`: The recipient's email address (e.g., `support@elegalsamadhan.com`).
        *   `subject`: The email subject line.
        *   `html` or `text`: The formatted email content, incorporating the user's form data.
        *   `reply_to`: (Optional but recommended) Set to the user's email address from the form, so replies go directly to the user.
    *   Resend's infrastructure handles the complexities of sending the email, managing deliverability, and maintaining IP reputation.

6.  **API Response (Backend -> Frontend)**
    *   The API route waits for the response from the Resend API call.
    *   Based on whether Resend reported success or failure:
        *   **On Success:** The API route sends a successful HTTP response back to the frontend (e.g., status code `200 OK` with a JSON body like `{ "message": "Message sent successfully!" }`).
        *   **On Error:** The API route logs the error (server-side) and sends an error HTTP response back to the frontend (e.g., status code `500 Internal Server Error` or `400 Bad Request` with a JSON body like `{ "error": "Failed to send message." }`).

7.  **Handling Response (Frontend)**
    *   The frontend `fetch` call receives the response from the API route.
    *   It checks the response status (`response.ok` or `response.status`).
    *   **On Success:** Updates the component's state (`submissionStatus = 'success'`), displays a success message to the user, potentially clears the form fields, and resets the loading state.
    *   **On Error:** Updates the component's state (`submissionStatus = 'error'`), displays an appropriate error message (potentially using the error detail from the API response body), and resets the loading state.

## Key Components & Concepts

*   **Client Component (`'use client'`):** Necessary in Next.js App Router for components using React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) and browser event handlers (`onSubmit`).
*   **API Route:** A serverless function within the Next.js project (`/app/api/...` or `/pages/api/...`) that acts as a backend endpoint. It's essential for secure operations.
*   **Transactional Email Service (TES):** An external service (like Resend, SendGrid, Mailgun) specialized in sending application-generated emails reliably.
*   **Environment Variables (`.env.local`):** A file (ignored by Git) to store sensitive information like API keys. Accessible *only* on the server-side via `process.env`.
*   **`fetch` API:** The standard browser mechanism for making asynchronous HTTP requests.
*   **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** The common data format used for exchanging data between the frontend and the backend API.

## Why This Pattern?

*   **Security:** Protects sensitive credentials (API keys) by keeping them exclusively on the server-side.
*   **Reliability:** Leverages the robust infrastructure and deliverability expertise of dedicated email services.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** The frontend focuses on user interface and interaction, while the backend (API route) handles business logic and secure external communications.
